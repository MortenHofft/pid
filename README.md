A very simple attempt to visualise stability of GBIF occurrence IDs 

GBIF Occurrence IDs are only as stable as the IDs of the publishers. Or, slightly more stable, as thre are attempts to detect if a publisher has changed all their IDs and then they will sometimes be atumatocally remapped, but often the GBIF occurrence IDs are lost of the publisher decides to assign new IDs to all their records.

This projet tries to visualise how stable IDs have been using past snapshots as a reference
